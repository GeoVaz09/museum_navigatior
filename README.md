Right now there are two museums in English with one exhibit each:
<ul>
  <li><strong>You can type:</strong> museum_1 and 5634 to learn about Athena</li>
  <li><strong>You can type:</strong> museum_2 and 9734 to learn about Zeus</li>
</ul>
<p>* I would add some images of statues but I don;t know how</p>
